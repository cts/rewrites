<p><a title="TOC" href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Theory of Computation (TOC)</a> is the study of the inherent capabilities and limitations of computers: not just the computers of today, but any computers that could ever be built. By its nature, the subject is close to mathematics, with progress made by conjectures, theorems, and proofs. What sets TOC apart, however, is its goal of understanding computation &#8212; not only as a tool but as a fundamental phenomenon in its own right.</p>
<p>At MIT, we are interested in a broad range of TOC topics, including algorithms, complexity theory, cryptography, distributed computing, computational geometry, computational biology, and quantum computing.<br />

<p>The <a title="CIS" href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/" target="_blank">CIS group</a> seeks to develop techniques for securing tomorrow&#8217;s global information infrastructure by exploring theoretical foundations, near-term practical applications, and long-range speculative research.We aim to understand the theoretical power of cryptography and the practical engineering of secure information systems, from appropriate definitions and proofs of security, through cryptographic algorithm and protocol design, to implementations of real applications with easy-to-use security features.We are also interested in the relationship of our field to others, such as complexity theory, quantum computing, algorithms, machine learning, and cryptographic policy debates.</p>

The <a title="Weizmann" href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/foundation.html" target="_blank">Weizmann Institute of Science</a> is one of the worldâ€™s leading multidisciplinary research institutions. Hundreds of scientists, laboratory technicians and research students working on its lushly landscaped campus embark daily on fascinating journeys into the unknown, seeking to improve our understanding of nature and our place within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guiding these scientists is the spirit of inquiry so characteristic of the human race. It is this spirit that propelled humans upward along the evolutionary ladder, helping them reach their utmost heights.</p>
<p>It prompted humankind to pursue agriculture, learn to build lodgings, invent writing, harness electricity to power emerging technologies, observe distant galaxies, design drugs to combat various diseases, develop new materials and decipher the genetic code embedded in all the plants and animals on Earth.</p>

<h5>ITCS STEERING COMMITTEE CHAIR</h5>
<p>The <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/newengland/events/itcs2012/" title="3rd link">3rd Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) </a>conference, sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT), was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 8-10, 2012 with a welcome reception on January 7.</p>
<p>ITCS (previously known as ICS) seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept or model, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or cross-interdisciplinary areas, or introducing new techniques or new applications of known techniques). ITCS welcomes all submissions, whether aligned with current theory of computation research directions or deviating from them.</p>
<p>ITCS 2012 is sponsored by SIGACT (ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory).</p>

<h5>TCC STEERING COMMITTEE</h5>
<p>The <a href="http://www.iacr.org/workshops/tcc2012/" title="9th conference">Ninth Theory of Cryptography Conference</a> was held in Taormina, Italy, sponsored by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). Papers presenting original research on foundational and theoretical aspects of cryptography are sought.</p>
<p>The Theory of Cryptography Conference deals with the paradigms, approaches, and techniques used to conceptualize natural cryptographic problems and provide algorithmic solutions to them. More specifically, the scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to the:
<ul>
  <li>Study of known paradigms, approaches, and techniques, directed towards their better understanding and utilization</li>
  <li>Discovery of new paradigms, approaches and techniques that overcome limitations of the existing ones</li>
  <li>Formulation and treatment of new cryptographic problems</li>
  <li>Study of notions of security and relations among them</li>
  <li>Modeling and analysis of cryptographic algorithms</li>
  <li>Study of the complexity assumptions used in cryptography</li>
</ul>
